## Assume ...
> Software is as important to modern scientific research as telescopes and test tubes. ... more and more of the daily operation of science revolves around developing new algorithms, managing and analyzing the large amounts of data that are generated in single research projects, combining disparate datasets to assess synthetic problems, and other computational task (Greg Wilson, 2014)

## What seems to happen
- Iron triangle of "hardware", "algorithm", "programming" (Greg Wilson, 2014)
- Iron quadrilateral? "Data", "Hardware", "Algorithm", "Programming"
- Everything other than programming has increased in logarithmic scale

## Greg Wilson (2014)
> A million-fold speed-up is impressive, but hardware and algorithms are only two sides of the iron triangle of programming. **The   third is programming itself, and while improvements to languages,   tools, and practices have undoubtedly made software developers   more productive since 1987, the speed-up is percentages rather   than orders of magnitude**

## Software carpentry history
- Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda started in 1998
- Three phases, current phase started in 2012
- Network of communities connecting learners, instructors, trainers, lesson maintainers

## History and growth

## Carpentries Workshop
![workshop](carpentries_workshop.jpeg)

## Top features of software/data carpentry workshops
- Computational competence
- Show not tell: Live coding (Computer Science meets Fine Arts)
- Guided instruction
- Novice to competent practitioner/journeyman 

## What goes on in a software/data carpentry workshop
- Day 1 am: Unix shell
- Day 1 pm: Programming in Python or R
- Day 2 am: Version control (git)
- Day 2 pm: SQL (sqlite)

## What goes on in a data carpentry workshop (R for example, ecology)
- Day 1 am: Spreadsheets and OpenRefine
- Day 1 pm: Programming in R
- Day 2 am: ggplot or plotting
- Day 2 pm: Sql and version control

## Lessons for data and software carpentry

| Data/Software | Day  | Time | Topic |
|---------------|------|------|-------|
| Software      | One  | AM   | The Unix shell |
| Data          | One  | AM   | OpenRefine/Spreadsheet |
| Software, Data| One  | PM   | R / Python |
| Software, Data      | Two  | AM   | Version control |
| Software, Data      | Two  | PM   | SQL   |

## Steps of workshops

## Lessons
[Go to ...](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)


## Selection of topics
- Should be hands-on
- Develop using a template with objectives and tasks
- Emphasis on 'show not tell'
- Should incorporate 'live coding'
- Should include frequent formative assessments
- One formative assessment every 15 minutes (usually less frequent)

## Impact on research productivity (long term survey results)

|research_productivity |   n| percent|
|:---------------------|---:|-------:|
|Agree                 | 153|   32.14|
|Disagree              |  39|    8.19|
|Neutral               | 138|   28.99|
|Strongly agree        |  58|   12.18|
|Strongly disagree     |  20|    4.20|

## Change in confidence level

|confidence_change          |   n| percent|
|:--------------------------|---:|-------:|
|I'm equally confident now. |  93|   19.54|
|I'm less confident now.    |   6|    1.26|
|I'm more confident now.    | 333|   69.96|

## Get Involved in The Carpentries
 [Go to ...](https://carpentries.org/community/)
 
## Some suggested ways for individuals 
- Start as a learner
- Usually in groups 
- Each learner helps each other
- Work in pairs rather than solo works better
- Learner -> Helper -> Instructor -> Trainer
- Pull requests -> Lesson developer -> Maintainer
