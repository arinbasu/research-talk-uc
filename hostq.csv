Sabry has some good ideas for how our lessons should be maintained/managed, and Elena is interested in contributing to the HPC novice lesson (I suggested that she contribute to Peter Steinbach's HPC-in-a-day lesson repo).",5,"Sabry pointed out that there is no established process to ensure that lessons are kept up-to-date or that PRs are dealt with in a timely fashion. He seemed frustrated by the dispersed communication channels for discussions relating to particular lessons. He believes that these conversations should happen on the lesson repositories themselves, so that there is an easily findable/searchable history of them in a single location. I think he has a good point. He was also unimpressed with how long it can take for PRs/issues to be addressed on lesson repos (e.g some open PRs dating back to 2015). I reminded him that lessons are maintained by volunteers and these people are often very busy with other things. but we might want to reach out to our maintainers and see how we can better support them? A final point, and IMO a *great* idea - there is no central location listing all lessons. Elena had to do a lot of internet detective work to find the hpc-novice lesson and even then didn't find Peter's hpc-in-a-day repo from there, which seems to be where the most active development of an HPC lesson is taking place. We should make an etherpad or some other site, listing *all* lessons - mature, retired/inactive, and in-development, so that would-be contributors can find them more easily.",,,,,,0

One question in particular relating of how to handle a disruptive participant was good. The whole aspect of enforcing the code of conduct to practical matters like if you arrive very late you will not be able to join in especially if there are limited helpers otherwise it could impact the exprience of the whole group.

    Doug - how did installation go? 

    Veronica - served breakfast an hour before the workshop and helped during this time; mostly went smooth except openrefine on handful of machines

    Pariksheet - similar strategy - advertised workshop start time earlier than the workshop; 2nd day people came in later (not as much setup but not ideal); openrefine on a Windows OS had to be rebooted; setup was R Studio and some people didn't understand they also needed to install R separately

    Pariksheet - using the https authentication setup caused some challenges; spent some extra time doing setup where they wouldn't have to do this every time

    Abigail - Q for Veronica.  For Library carpentry 2-day workshop, how many instructors did you have?  Did you have instructors do different parts?  How many different lessons have you been familiar enough to teach?

    Veronica - Head instructor.  Learned all lessons to be good enough to teach them.  Lead 2 sessions and helped three colleagues teach the others.  Helped writing notes.  As head instructor did a lot of the coordination and planning, stopping, pausing, sticky notes, not leaving people behind.

    Pariksheet - head instructor once, ^ a lot of reminding and coordination before and during workshop; if you're traveling to another site, coordinating with workshop host to make sure everything is set up

    Pariksheet - feel 2 instructors is minimum but more is better; 3 is ideal

    Veronica - instructors can be helpers when not teaching - all instructors was at workshop the entire time

    Jamie- clarification from last discussion section: certification for library carpentry.  Certification for software / data carpentry = library carpentry.  You're qualified to teach all.  There isn't a library carpentry specific certification yet.

    Sabah - have helped at a few workshops and one thing I've noticed is that there range ois often range of backgrounds. what are things you have done to adapt or address the diversity of the audience?

    Pariksheet - grouping people together can be very important as you're likely going to be using similar tools/running into similar problems, e.g. come with your lab members.

    Sabah - asked people what their skillset levels were in various programming/research tools; interdisciplinary and complementary pairings

    Rebecca- inevitable to get a mix.  Be clear in advertisiing of the workshop that it's for novice programmers.  As the registration is on-going it helps people decide if it's appropriate for them.

    Stacy - In teaching literature, mixed ability groups work better.  But which work better for us?

    Sabah - we started without data science resources on campus.  Found both- pairing people together that are interested in working the other language really well.  Pairing people working on a project / thesis / paper is better, otherwise people can be frustrated that are on the higher end of expertise.  For learning as a group we would be a complementary mixed group.

    Jamie- good feedback for how best to follow up discussion for a workshop.  Stay involved in the community as things are progressing - Hacky Hour, Greg's Brain Hack, could be community builder and opportunity to continue training beyond the workshop.

    Greg - Brain Hack events are primarily to build a community.  See brainhack.org - there's a public slack channel, 2000 members, 600 active at a given time.  That made our even successful, by giving them the opportunity to get answers to their questions later.

    Jamie - there's also a carpentry slack which is a good resources that has people of various levels of expertise to help instructors progress.",,,,,,4

Robin Donatello - Is hosting her first workshop soon but has been teaching these types of materials (maybe the actually lessons, unclear) in her undergraduate classes and had some great ideas.  I think she would be a great mentor or committee member.
",4,"There was some discussion of etherpad vs hackmd or other collaborative note-taking methods.  Seems like a lot in this group don't like etherpad too much(maybe why we didn't get much action in the notes?), though they didn't really have experience with other types of collaborative note taking either.
The pre-workshop attendee, Robin, is mixing together the DC and SWC workshops in her upcoming workshop (Spreadsheets, R -gapminder, unix, little bit of git w/R, + webpage design w/Rmd).  It will be interesting to see what feedback and contributions she has from this experience.",,,,,,1

Also they had a lot of teaching experience among them and would make good mentors after they've gotten some experience teaching a few workshops.,5,One of the pieces of feedback I got was that they felt that some of the instructor training materials were hard to find and so it was a bit unclear all the pieces that the need to do.  I know this is a work in progress but felt like it was worth noting.

One person thought the Python lesson was too advanced, and needed more explanation throughout the lesson. I received a lot of requests for people to join this discussion session, and I tried to accommodate everyone, but having so many people on a call caused a lot of technical problems. We found that things improved when everyone turned off their video, and so the discussion was done using Zoom audio without the video. That said, everyone did get a chance to speak, though I don't think I will take everyone's requests when I host another discussion session. ",,,,,,

We talked about other communication channels where they can reach out to see if instructors are nearby and want to collaborate.

- Is it possible / are there guidelines on splitting day-long lesson programs into multi-day programs? It might be useful to allow ample time to grasp concepts in some cases (novices vs experts)
- How much time should/can an instructor dedicate to helping a learner who's falling behind in a workshop, particularly where helpers are few?
- Recommendations for terminal colours appropriate for a workshop environment, as the traditional blue background makes it harder for some learners to follow along?
- Unix lesson materials default to Mac examples*. Any recommendations for succinct ways to explain the differences between mac,linux,windows without confusing learners?
- Some examples in the lessons are not optimal i.e. sort | uniq bash examples, FOR Loop recommendations et al. How best to communicate these differences?

I think some others signed up to attend did not because the session was no longer listed. The time of the discussion on the community calendar was incorrect (so I thankfully signed on to the call an hour early and was able to re-add our session to the etherpad before the call). I think most people were using the etherpad to schedule, because no one was on the call an hour early when I signed in, but this could have been confusing. We also had scheduling overlap with the next community call, which was unusually on the half hour. I didn't identify this until today because I was looking at the community calendar where our call was listed as an hour earlier than it was on the etherpad, so no overlap was shown. I used my zoom room for our call, and left clear instructions on the etherpad, but still some attendees for the overlapping call signed on in the middle of our discussion and had to be redirected. Finally, the people on the overlapping call cleared our notes in the etherpad again in the middle of our session, so we could not continue taking notes without restoring the previous version and deleting their current notes.

",5,"There was good discussion around use of Zoom and online instructor training versus face-to-face instructor training with merits of each, about running workshops on large screen-fitted large classrooms versus small rooms, using different types of operating systems and situations where operating systems would be different for the attendees as opposed to that of the instructor, use of virtual machines, using mybinders and hosting them on github can also serve as a rationale for teaching/learning git, and need to sort out the technology aspects before actual demo sessions for those who would be going for their demo sessions.

The disucssion was full and everyone really had a lot to say/ask questions about, so the conversation just went where it went. About half the group stayed to conintue the discussion for another 15 minutes after the session was over. It couldn't tell if this was a good thing or a bad thing, but everyone was really engaged.
